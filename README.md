# Udemy-The-Complete-Java-Development-Bootcamp
I was able to do the following by the end of the course 
>Use objects to write high-quality code.
>Apply exception handling to produce reliable code
>Use breakpoints to debug code.
>Use Test-Driven Development to polish your and avoid bugs.
>Leverage code-reusability with Inheritance and Polymorphism.
>Maximize performance with Concurrency.

Module 2 covered :
>Objects
>Exception Handling
>Debugging
>Unit Testing 
>Streams 
>Inheritance
>Polymorphism
>Concurrency

I was able to succeed in Module 2 due to the following basics that layed the foundation to my Java in Module 1:
>Variables, Conditionals, Functions, Loops, and Arrays.
>Store information inside variables.
>Control how code runs using conditionals.
>Organize code into functions.
>Run code in a loop.
>Store many values in an array.
